Preparation:
1. Ensure the preresuisites in README of the test kit are completed.
2. Edit the file ../../utils/dfs.json_Template to have correct connection string
    and appropriate workspaces
3. Ensure workloads/ contains the needed workload files, with filename as tpcds.workload.<SF>.lst
   where SF is the scale factor.  The file contains one row for each table in the format:
    <table name>    <number of chunks>

To create the data set and build the parquet database, for scale factor X:
./build_tpcdsParquetDB.sh X  

e.g.:
./build_tpcdsParquetDB.sh 100
